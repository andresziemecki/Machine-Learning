# Machine-Learning
Exercises of the Machine Learning course at Stanford where each one has the following topics:  
  
Ex 1:   
    * Implementations of linear regression and get to see it work on data:  
        - Profit prediction for a food track using linear Regression   
        - Price of Houses prediction with Linear regression using multiple variables  
Ex 2:   
    * Implementation of logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets:  
        - Prediction where students gets admitted into a University using logistic regression  
        - Prediction whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA) using logistic regression  
Ex 3:  
    * Recognize hand-written digits using logistic regression and neural networks  
    * Implementation of one-vs-all classification by training multiple regularized logistic regression clasifiers  
Ex 4:  
    * Implementation of backpropagation algorithm for neural networks and apply it to the task of hand-written digit recognition  
Ex 5:   
    * Implementation of regularized linear regression and use it to study models with different bias'variance properties.  
        - Prediction of the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir with regularized linear regression  
Ex 6:   
    * Implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to build a spam filter  
Ex 7:  
    * Implementation of K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image.  
    * Use of principal component analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction of face images.  
Ex 8:  
    * Implementation of anonimaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.  
    * Implementation of colaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
